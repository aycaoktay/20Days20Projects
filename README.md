# 20Days20Projects

This repository contains a series where I created small-scale projects every day for 20 days. Each project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technical and General Features

- All projects are developed using the basic web technologies: **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
- Projects are designed to be simple and instructional.
- Each project consists of a single page and has a simple user interface.
- Each project is designed to be **responsive**, adapting to different screen sizes.
- Projects are developed to work smoothly in modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
